**#Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?**

Artimis financial is a financial institution and thus has to adhere to certain regulations with regards to security, they wanted me to ensure their software was secure by doing a variety of tests.

**#What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?**

Software security creates trust in current and future clients, and it helps avoid losses due to theft or lawsuit. It is important to code securely because it removes commonly exploited software vulnerabilities and prevents cyberattacks.

**#What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?**

I found it difficult to locate the dependency check at first. I didn’t know where it was stored and thus had to do some research. The hardest task I encountered was setting up secure communication and making the ports work.

**#How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?**

In order to increase layers of security I had multiple types of testing for the different stages of the software. Some of this testing came in the form of manual code reviews, dependency checks, error management, encapsulation and frequent updates. For future projects I would like to establish network access controls and monitor network traffic.

**#How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**

I would ensure the code was functional by manually checking it and then seeing if it would run as expected. I would also use the spring tool and dependency checks. In order to check if any new vulnerabilities were introduced I would run a dependency check and see if anything showed up. I would also take a break and manually review the code another day.

**#What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?**

I find the dependency checks, spring tool and setting up port communication helpful for future projects.

**#Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?**

This assignment helped me learn about useful tools but more importantly it helped me gain a new perspective on what can be done with java and programing in general. It made me research more and read more about it than any other project, it gave me curiosity as to what can be done with programming.
